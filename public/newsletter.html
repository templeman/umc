<br />
Neighbor 2 Neighbor is now the name of the umbrella organization covering all our<br />
Homeless ministries. Please see the descriptions below:<br />
<br />
<em>Veda&rsquo;s Breakfast</em><br />
Every Sunday a number of homeless and low income persons find a hot meal and a sack lunch in<br />
our church at 8:00am. Veda Spencer, a member of the First Christian Church started this ministry<br />
but it is continuing with the help of some of our members and others from the community.<br />
<br />
<em>Walk the Walk Dinner</em><br />
Every Wednesday, we provide the space for over 60 homeless or low income persons to receive<br />
a free dinner. We partner with members of the First Assembly Church to provide this ministry.<br />
We have also made a classroom available for a clothes closet open to these same persons that<br />
night.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Helping Hand Needs<br />
As always, there is a need for small (travel size) containers of personal hygiene items, like<br />
deodorant, soap, etc. Regular items like the list below are needed as well: peanut butter and jelly,<br />
cereal, canned fruit, (small and medium containers), juice, spaghetti and spaghetti sauce and tuna.<br />
Please note: we still need another representative for the Board from our church.</div>
