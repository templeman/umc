	<h3>
		From the Pastor...
	</h3>
<p>
	The Western Jurisdiction has ratified the assignments of its Committee on Episcopacy for five episcopal areas. Following action of the 2008 General Conference, the jurisdiction has restructured its episcopal areas so that a new Greater Northwest Episcopal Area, with episcopal residence in Normandy Park, Washington, will provide leadership for the Alaska United Methodist Conference, Pacific Northwest Annual Conference, and the Oregon-Idaho Annual Conference. This creates the largest geographic episcopal area in the United States. Bishop Grant J. Hagiya has been assigned to the Great Northwest Area.
</p>
<p>
	Other assignments made by the conference were: Bishop Minerva Carca&ntilde;o to the Los Angeles Area (California-Pacific Annual Conference), Bishop Robert Hoshibata to the Phoenix Area (Desert Southwest Annual Conference), Bishop Elaine Stanovsky to the Mountain Sky Area (Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain Annual Conferences), and Bishop Warner H. Brown, Jr. to the San Francisco Area (California-Nevada Annual Conference). Bishop Hagiya will be traveling through the Conferences and hopefully, we will get an apopportunity to meet him soon. As you know Lowell Greathouse is our new District superintendent. He will be at a gathering September 22 in Hermiston to meet church members and get to know us a little better. Each church will be bringing gifts to welcome him.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to Wanda and others who led worship Sunday while I was at the School of Christian Mission (which will be called Mission U from now on). We learned a lot about Ministry with the Poor, and Immigration, and I will be sharing some of what I learned as time goes on.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks also to those of you who helped with food for the Fire Benefit, those who made donations and those who worked that night.<br />
See you in church!
</p>
	<p>
		Grace and peace,
	</p>
	<p>
		Pastor Sandy

	<h3>Day Shelter Committee being formed</h3>
	<p>
		A few weeks back when the temps rose to three digits, Pastor Sandy received a call from St. Anthony Hospital asking if we had opened a cooling station and we realized how much a Day Shelter is needed. Heat can be just as dangerous as cold for persons living on the street. If you would like to be a part of this new ministry, there will be a meeting on Thursday, June 9th.
	</p>
	<h3>Sharing of Joys and Concerns</h3>

<h3>Thanks...</h3>

	<h3>
		UMW NEWS
	</h3>
<p>
	Pastor Sandy and Virginia Conrad attended the UMW School of Mission in Boise, ID this past weekend. As always the studies were well done and gave much food for thought. We will not have a meeting in August. Our September meeting will be the 5th and we will again host the AFS students for Round-up. The last meeting of the Central District UMW will be in the Dalles on Sept. 8. Pastor Sandy will be the speaker. Watch the Web Page and the Sunday bulletin for more information.
</p>
	<h3>
		Stewardship of God's Gifts
	</h3>
		<p>
			We would like to thank you all once a gain for sharing your gifts with the church. Both your talents and your money. You are always extremely generous, but we continue to need your help. As I mentioned last month, giving to the General Fund is not covering all the expenses of the church, and we have not been able to pay our part of the Shared Ministry Apportionments at the level we should. For the nonth of July, we were behind around $1,000 not counting our Shared Ministry Apportionments. We need your help and special gifts are always appreciated.
		</p>
	<h3>
		Evening Bible Study to Start
	</h3>
	<p>
		Pastor Sandy will be starting a new Bible Study after Round Up on Thursday nights, possibly at Prodigal Son. If you are interested, let her know.
